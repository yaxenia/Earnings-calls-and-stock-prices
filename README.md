Earnings call conferences are an important source of information influencing the future development of a company. In this project, we will evaluate the impact of earnings conferences on the stock price in general and separately test the impact of the report's tone on stock price movements. Also in this research, we have develop a binary classifier that predicts the rise or fall of the share price in 30 days based on earnings call transcripts.
